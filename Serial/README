To compile:
```
make
```
To run the program (Linux)
```
./pedestrian
```
To see the routes of the agents graphically, run using:
```
./predestrian -g
```
NOTE: The graphical portion is in openGL/GLUT.

NOTE: This code can also be used to graphically display the vision of an agent, i.e. view all the spaces the agent can see.
To visualise the radar, in file "Agent.cc", in function "radarVision()", uncomment the compiler directives.
This is required as, thus far, the graphics portion is set up to show either the path of the agent, or what the agent sees, but not both.

To compile with debug flag -g:
```
make debug
```
To remove executable and object files:
```
make clean
```
